## Overview

This application is a group collaboration where we created a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and plan shopping trips around them. We got some of our inspiration from [New York Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/). Users should view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook.
